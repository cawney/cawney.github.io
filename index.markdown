## James Carney's Code

This isn't very exciting. It's just some random projects I've been working on that are pretty average.

If you like what you see, use it or tell me. I don't care. I'm not doing this for you. I'm doing it so I can learn.

## James' life

If I'm not putting code on here. I'm going to be talking about money or God or whatever I want to get off my chest. I'm not looking for validation. I'm looking for clarity and a way to get stuff off my chest.
