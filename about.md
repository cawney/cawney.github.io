# James Carney's About

I'm James. I work with horses for my main job. You can check it out [here](https://pedigreepro.net) and have a little blog about them [here](https://horseyrun.com). This site is for me to showcase my 'coding' skills and learn some more stuff about code.

My main focus is on the stuff on HorseyRun and PedigreePro.
