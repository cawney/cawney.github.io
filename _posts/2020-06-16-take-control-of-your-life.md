This is a book review of Mel Robin's book, Take Control of your life. I don't think it's an actual book. I think it's just an audio book.

I wasn't expecting it, but it was a bunch of different coaching calls with Mel giving some general feedback at the end for all of them. The general theme of the book was that everyone has some fears that keep them from living their life the way they want to. I'm going to dive in and talk about each call and some key takeaways from each.

## Coaching Call #1

First call was with a man named Dan who felt like he wasn't going to figure out what he wanted to do with his life. He was a super active and his brain was all over the place. He wanted to do a bunch of different things.

The key takeway for him was to **slow down** and do small things every day towards your end goal. For him, he wants to open up a small wine bar. That is a big reach for him to go from zero to owning a wine bar, so his solution was to find a job at a winery and work there to see if he liked it. If he likes it, then go a step further and keep inching your way to your end goal. Let changes happen to it every day.
