I just finished reading a book called Digital Minimalism. I was pretty happy with it. I wanted to come to peace with not wanting to spend as much time on my phone, and this book seemed to get me in a direction that I'd be happy with. When I started the book I was averaging more than 5 hours on my phone a day. I also worked full time.

I'm *supposed* to work 8 hours a day, then I had 5 hours on my phone a day and then throw in sleeping and time with family, my day is done. Between work and my phone, that is a little more than 1/2 the total day. And then sleep (11pm - 5:45 am). That's about 20 hours of my day where I'm not actively focused on my family or myself. I can't change sleep that much. I have a lot more control over the first 2 (work and phone). I'm not working 8 hours a day. I'm usually at the office for 9 hours a day, but I'm not working that whole time.

I have been known to play on my phone while at the office from time to time. So if I limit the amount of time on my phone at the office, I might not even have to be at the office for 9 hours a day. I don't have a time quota to meet. I have a work quota to meet. So if I can get the work done, it doesn't matter how much or how little I work.

I also spend a lot of time on the phone after I put my son to be and before I go to bed. So that's from about 9 to 11 PM. If I can cut that out and spend that time reading books, then I could read about 50 pages of a book. Average book being around 250 pages, then I could read 3 new books every month just from that extra found time.

By cutting phone time after I put my son to bed, I can get about 2 hours a day of my life.

## Places to cut phone use

I've been cutting my phone use by doing some little times like deleting high usage apps off my phone. Goodbye Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Reddit
