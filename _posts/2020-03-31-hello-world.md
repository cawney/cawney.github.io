# Hello!

I'm a pedigree writer who wants to learn more about coding. I don't want to be a developer, I want to be a horseman who can code. So this isn't my main focus. It will be a spot for me to currate some code and chances are no one will read this but me.

I will be posting projects I'm working on and trying to polish them into something useful mostly for me, but can maybe be used by other people. Only time will tell.
