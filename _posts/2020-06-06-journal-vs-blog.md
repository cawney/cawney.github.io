I enjoy blogging. Not because I like to tell people about myself or that I want to build an online business or a following. I really don't care about that. I like it because I treat it like a journal. For me, it's no different than if I opened a word document, typed everything I was thinking and then saved it and forgot about it.

I've been reading through a few books that have made me question it. I'm reading digital minimalism which talked about the importance of journaling for hashing out ideas and there was something said about writing them down on paper. I can see that. I'm much more deliberate when I'm writing on paper and it seems to help me. I've also been reading some stuff by Jordan Peterson that talked about how you should always present yourself in the best light. An online journal filled with ramblings just isn't a very good way to do that. I've also read a lot by a guy who I'm blanking on his name, but is always super vulnerable to his audience and reveals his worst characteristics so he's more relatable.

I'm somewhere in the middle I guess. It's easier to hash out an idea on the computer since I can type faster and longer than I can write, but there is something personal about a computer. It also doesn't have to be black and white. I can write in a journal and on a computer to hash out something I'm struggling with. Hence this post.

The nice thing about posting it online is that I can look at what I wrote from anywhere. The downside is that anyone else can see it too. Then that begs the question, do I care? No, not really.
