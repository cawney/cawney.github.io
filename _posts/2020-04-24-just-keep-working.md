I am trying to learn Python and SQL. I'm working specifically with SQLite3 since it seems to be tied directly with Python. It seemed like a good fit. I have no idea what I'm doing half the time, but I have a project I'm trying to get done while we are in lockdown, and now seemed like a good time to learn a new skill and put that together.
