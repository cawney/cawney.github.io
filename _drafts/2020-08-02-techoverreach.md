# Theme

This book will be a distopian, near future book that is going to be similar to 1984. It will be more geared towards tech overreach vs government overreach.

It will use all the features that we think as selling points (it always knows where you are so it can get you the best routes somewhere) and use it against you. * It always knows where you are so it can give you a better route, now turned into it always knows where you are so if you associate with someone who is on a list of the intelectual darkweb, you can be guilty by association.

My alarm went off at 5:30 like it does every morning. I heated up day old coffee and sipped on that while I read on my Bible. I turn my phone off and leave it in the bed room so it isn't able to listen to me talk to my wife about what we are reading. She does the same thing.

5:30 to 6 AM is the only time when we don't have our devices on until bed time. We read for about 15 minutes and talk about what we read for the next 15 minutes before we get ready to leave for the day. If we had our phones out, they'd be listening to what we were saying and we would get a saction from the local government for "hate speech" since the Bible forbids same sex marriage.

The listening started out as harmless. We would get ads on Facebook and Instagram for products that we were actively searching for. We didn't think anything of it. Sort of like you get a brand new Jeep and you start seeing that same Jeep everywhere even though you didn't see a lot of them before that. That's all anyone assumed.

A few right wing conspiracy theorist posited that they were listening to our conversations for the purpose of selling our attention to advertisers. Most people assumed these were tin foiled right wing nut jobs and didn't take their thoughts seriously.

That's when Big Tech started to push the envelope of what was appropriate and we started to notice something strange. They started making products for the sole purpose was to listen to our conversations so that we might give up information on how they can sell more to us.
